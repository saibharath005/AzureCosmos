# Azure Cosmos NoSQL Variation

This page is created to navigate between the code files that I have created for connecting to Cosmos NoSQL version using either Python or the PySpark framework.

## Library Versions
### Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install azure-cosmos==4.3.1
```
### Pyspark Depedencies [Maven Based]
#### Databricks Runtime: 13.3 LTS (includes Apache Spark 3.4.1, Scala 2.12)

## Navigation

I have created .py files for download and play around in the Python files folder and for quick navigation and overview of the working code pieces I have created ipnyb files along with the sample outputs.
