# Azure Cosmos MongoDB Variation

This page is created to navigate between the code files that I have created for connecting to Cosmos MongoDB version using either Python or the PySpark framework.

## Library Versions
### Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install pymongo==4.10.1
```
### Pyspark Depedencies [Maven Based]
#### Spark Version 3.0 and Above
```bash
org.mongodb.spark:mongo-spark-connector_2.12:3.0.1
```

## Navigation

I have created .py files for download and play around in the Python files folder and for quick navigation and overview of the working code pieces I have created ipnyb files along with the sample outputs.
